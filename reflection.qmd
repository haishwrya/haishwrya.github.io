# Reflection on the Use of GenAI

## Tool Used
I used **ChatGPT (OpenAI)** for the development of this Quarto website.

## Why I Chose It
- Easy to access
- Good understanding of RStudio and Quarto
- Provides markdown-friendly guidance

## How It Helped
- Helped me structure `_quarto.yml` and markdown files
- Suggested how to use navigation bar and themes
- Guided me in writing cleaner CSS and YAML configs

## Benefits
- Saves time
- Reduces trial and error
- Improves learning by giving clear explanations

## Challenges
- Sometimes gives too much detail or code that needs adjusting
- Cannot see my live file system, so I need to interpret its guidance

## Future Use
I plan to use GenAI tools to:
- Draft reports and proposals
- Learn new languages or tools
- Debug code
